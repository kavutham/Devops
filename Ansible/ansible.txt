Ansible Installation on Linux 7.2

I. 	SSH Preparation
II.	SSH Execution
III.	Ansible Installation
IV.	Ansible Configuration

I. SSH Preparation for Master and Webgroup (All Nodes)

1) Create couple of instances at AWS and Select Red Hot Linux images 7.2 Version
	Namely as Master and Webgroup

2)	Change ec2-user to root user by applying
	sudo -i

3)	Go to root user and obtain root user password
	passwd root
	
4)	Go to cd /etc/ssh and edit at sshd_config file as per below

	Uncommnad the # key of PermitRootLogin yes
        (Delete # key)
	Uncommand the # key on PasswordAuthentication yes
	

5)	Restart the sshd service by applying below
	systemctl restart sshd (for all instances such as Master and Webgroup)

6)	Apply visudo commands for all machine
	Add below one at last line

	root	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL 
	__________________________________________________________________________________________

II.	SSH Execution (Master Only)

1) ssh-keygen 
Now key has generated which need to be shared across all machine for connection without password

2) ssh-copy-id username@workernode Private Ip Address

Apply ssh-copy-id of all as per combination (ssh-copy-id username@172.31.18.172) : Private Ip Address

Example: if you are in master, ssh-copy-id root@172.31.18.172

Check whether ssh key is working or not (First time ask for passwor and no prompt for asking password 2nd time onwards)

3) ssh root@ip address (root is a user name and each machine communicate each other w/o asking password)

root is a user name, you need to apply as per your user

You can refer ip address where you can make the differnces.

By applying exit command, switch from Webgroup to Master

III.	Ansible Installation

At Control Server only (Master)

yum update -y
yum repolist
yum install wget -y
wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
rpm -ivh epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
yum install ansible -y

Ensure that ansible has installed or not, by applying the following

ansible --version
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

IV.	Ansible Configuration (Master)

Go to /etc/ansible folder
You get the hosts file
Open with vi hosts
Go to last line, create a group as per below
[webgroup]
below add private ip of webgroup (Pvt id of worker node)

List out all hosts details

ansible all --list-hosts

apply below

ansible all -m ping
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

Pratice
Go to "/etc/ansible" folder and open hosts file with "vi hosts" and add few hosts groups and name of the hosts

ansible --list-hosts all	
ansible --list-hosts "*"
ansible --list-hosts loadbalancer
ansible --list-hosts webserver
ansible --list-hosts webserver:loadbalancer
ansible --list-hosts webserver[0]
ansible --list-hosts webserver[1]
ansible --list-hosts \!loadbalancer
(Display all groups other than Load Balancer group)

Schedule a Playbook Using Cron

As an additional option, you can schedule a playbook to run at a specific time using your servers cron command! To accomplish this, log in to your server as root and run the following command:

At Master Node 

crontab -e

This command opens a temporary cron file in your system’s default text editor and then simply add a line like so:

* * * * * /usr/bin/ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/multiplepck.yaml

this will run the/etc/ansible/playbooks/multiplepck.yaml file at every one minutes. using the ansible-playbook command.
